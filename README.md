# APCSTetris
For the final project of an AP Computer Science class back in high school, I had successfully remade Tetris through Java. Albeit the simple visuals, this remake follows most rules and guidelines from the official Nintendo Entertainment System release. As a bonus, I had also converted the project into another version replacing the tetrominoes with pentominoes.

Controls:
Left/Right: Move Piece
S/D: Rotate Piece
Space: Hard Drop (Not available in Pentris)
